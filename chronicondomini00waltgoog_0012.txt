ΙΝ the Preface to the former volume of this
Chronicle some observatione were offered on its
historica] velue, aud the life os its author; hut,
an opinion that thessportion subsequent to the
year 1297 was written hy a continuator at a
later period was not aduertedto.1 The abrupt
termination of three of the MSS. at that year,
and the intention expressed in the prologue of
bringing the History down to the year 1300,
appear to have been the principa] causes which
led to this supposition3 but there is reason sor
helioving that the whole of the reign of Ed-
ward I., if not of Edward II. and ΙΙΙ., came

which conclude at the year 1297 are, the MS.
at the College of Arms? MS. Cotton. Tiberius
Β. rv., and the MS. R. 7, 9, in Trinity Collega
Cambridge. These MSS. are well written on
