vellum3 but, with the exception of the last, are
not of a very early date. On the other hand,
hlS. Lansdown‚ which is of higher antiquity, ’
apparently contemporary, concludes with the
death of Edward I.‚ and attributes the whole
to Hemingburgh. MSS. C. G. C. Cant. 250, and
Stowe, 11. xlviii„ the latter written in 1533,
have the Chronicle complete to the accession of
Edward ΙΙΙ., and MS. Coll. Trin. R. 5, 10,
the whole History, from the Conquest to the
Battle of Cressy. Internal evidence goes far to
strengthen the above view. Under the year
1297, before the conclusion of any of the Manu·
scriptS, the following expression occurs, “ by
the mediation of the venerable father, the Arch-
bishop of Canterbnry, Rohert de Wynchelse,
whose memory is blessed,’'¹ which shows that
Hemingburgh was living after the death of
Robert Winchelsey, llth May, 1313, and that
the reign of Edward I. was compiled at some
period subsequent to the accession of Edward
ll. And in laea we have adirect reference
to Gisburn in the following passage:—“ The
same year, on the l7th of February, died Lord
John de Bulmer, a gallant height, and most
estimable neighbour, and was buried at Gisburn‚
before the altar of St. J ohn the Baptist.''²
